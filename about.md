HorusAI is a medical artificial intelligence startup from
Melbourne, Australia. In Egyptian mythology, Horus symbolised healing,
restoration and sacrifice. Our goals are to accelerate the adoption of medical AI systems around the world, with involvement and consideration for disadvantaged populations. Our first project is in malaria diagnostics.

We'd like to think that medicine is a cutting edge field welcoming and harnessing technological advancements, but it consistently trails behind other sectors. For example, Blockchain technology is redefining FinTech but one would never dream of applying the Blockchain as a next-generation medical record in this current environment. Global and public health lags even further behind with examples of disruptive innovation far and few.

Artificial intelligence presents a highly unique opportunity to disrupt the practice of medicine in both developed and developing countries. Algorithms, once built, can be provided to anyone in the world with an internet connection at very low cost. This is a powerful thought. Although one may believe "doing good" to be confined to the realms of non-profit organisations, there is no logical reason why such a separation must occur. A business can and should generate a measureable social impact alongside a strong financial return, a concept known as impact investment.

It is with all this in mind that we have created HorusAI, a medical artificial intelligence company with a mission to harness AI technology to solve medical problems in both developed and developing countries. In doing so, we hope to accelerate research into medical AI and advance the adoption of systems around the world. Stay tuned.

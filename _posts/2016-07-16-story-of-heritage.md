Our story starts with the idea of **disruption**. It is a term often used by
innovators and since its modern inception beyond  "social upset", it has become the go-to buzzword for many entrepreneurs, investors and technological enthusiasts. The roots of "Disruptive Innovation" lies with Professor Clayton Christensen at Harvard Business School, who characterised it as a service or product which takes root in simple applications. The product begins at the bottom of the market before relentlessly moving up, displacing established competitors. Themes of Disruptive Innovation are found in Agile/Lean methodology and design thinking, both of which champion rapid iteration and customer consciousness.

We'd like to think that medicine is a cutting edge field welcoming and harnessing technological advancements, but it consistently trails behind other sectors. For example, Blockchain technology is redefining FinTech but one would never dream of applying the Blockchain as a next-generation medical record in this current environment. Global and public health lags even further behind with examples of disruptive innovation far and few.

Artificial intelligence presents a highly unique opportunity to disrupt the practice of medicine in both developed and developing countries. Algorithms, once built, can be provided to anyone in the world with an internet connection at very low cost. This is a powerful thought. Although one may believe "doing good" to be confined to the realms of non-profit organisations, there is no logical reason why such a separation must occur. A business can and should generate a measureable social impact alongside a strong financial return, a concept known as impact investment. Accelerating the world's transition to sustainable transportation lies in the tenets of Tesla Motors.

It is with all this in mind that we have created HorusAI, a medical artificial intelligence company with a mission to harness AI technology to solve medical problems in both developed and developing countries. In doing so, we hope to accelerate research into medical AI and advance the adoption of systems around the world.
